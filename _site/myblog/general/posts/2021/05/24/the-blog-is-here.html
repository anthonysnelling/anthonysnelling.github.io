<p>The blog is finally here! It’s been awhile, but I finally had the time to implement one. It’s still got some work to do with styling and such,
but I functionally it should be up and running.</p>

<p>I mostly plan on blogging about things I am working on, but I may also blog about some things I am thinking about or some of my hobbies.
I look forward to making more posts in the future.</p>
