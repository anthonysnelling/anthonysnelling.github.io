The blog is finally here! Well if you visited the page at all you may have seen some different iterations, as I worked out the details, 
but I feel I finally got it in a state that I like. 

I plan on using this blog to talk about a variety of things, from progamming, to art, to just my thoughts on certain things. Maybe I will even do 
a movie review or something haha.

As of right now I got my first job as a software engineer! So far it has been great! I am still very new and have a lot to learn, working on 
software for a company is very different than individual projects. 

Right now I am getting training and learning more about the business and the high level overview of how everything works. I think its a good way to 
learn things from the ground up before diving into the deeper subject, know how the business works and what customers go through before trying to 
implement things.

I look forward to learning and growing more as a software engineer and look forward to reading some more posts!
